"Are You Satisfied?"
by MARINA

I was pulling out my hair
The day I got the deal, chemically calm
Was I meant to feel happy that my life
Was just about to change?

One life pretending to be the cat who got the cream
Oh, everybody said, "Marina is a dreamer"
People like to tell you what you're gonna be
It's not my problem if you don't see what I see
And I do not give a damn if you don't believe

My problem, it's my problem
That I never am happy
It's my problem, it's my problem
On how fast I will succeed

Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?

High achiever, don't you see?
Baby, nothing comes for free
They say I'm a control freak
Driven by a greed to succeed
Nobody can stop me

'Cause it's my problem if I want to pack up and run away
It's my business if I feel the need to smoke and drink and sway
It's my problem, it's my problem if I feel the need to hide
And it's my problem if I have no friends and feel I want to die

Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Once you cross the line, will you be satisfied?
